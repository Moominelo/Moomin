16
00:01:58,219 --> 00:02:01,219
He can fly wherever he or she is.

17
00:02:02,219 --> 00:02:07,219
The only sadness is that only a single traveler is involved.

18
00:02:10,219 --> 00:02:13,219
Miska, the avoidance is just like this!

19
00:02:13,219 --> 00:02:14,219
So so!

20
00:02:14,219 --> 00:02:17,219
Sniff doesn't want another flight!

21
00:02:17,219 --> 00:02:18,219
Well not!

22
00:02:18,219 --> 00:02:20,219
Sniff you had misfortune.

23
00:02:20,219 --> 00:02:22,219
That day was ferocious Uuli.

24
00:02:22,219 --> 00:02:23,219
It was afraid.

25
00:02:23,219 --> 00:02:24,219
There were deer.

26
00:02:24,219 --> 00:02:27,219
At the very least, they could still be.

27
00:02:29,219 --> 00:02:31,219
A-Kuaa!

28
00:02:31,219 --> 00:02:33,219
A-Kuaa!

29
00:02:33,219 --> 00:02:35,219
A-Kuaa!

30
00:02:35,219 --> 00:02:37,219
A-Kuaa!

31
00:02:37,219 --> 00:02:40,219
At least it is possible to control the bouquet.

32
00:02:40,219 --> 00:02:43,219
Sniff you disturb.

33
00:02:43,219 --> 00:02:45,219
That's what you have calculated!

34
00:02:45,219 --> 00:02:47,219
Calculate the throw!

35
00:02:47,219 --> 00:02:49,219
Look at me to guide.

36
00:02:51,219 --> 00:02:54,219
That's the language and this was afraid of fire and receivable.

37
00:02:54,219 --> 00:02:56,219
But I still nip.

38
00:02:56,219 --> 00:02:59,219
How could you have landed?

39
00:02:59,219 --> 00:03:01,219
If you prevented you from guiding this?

40
00:03:01,219 --> 00:03:03,219
Well I don't know.

41
00:03:03,219 --> 00:03:05,219
I'm not what no birds.

42
00:03:05,219 --> 00:03:09,219
Good thing here that you happily got to the ground.

43
00:03:09,219 --> 00:03:12,219
Yes, I would go here for the Tiiäno ship.

44
00:03:12,219 --> 00:03:14,219
True!

45
00:03:17,219 --> 00:03:20,219
We have a slipping flight today.

46
00:03:20,219 --> 00:03:21,219
Yeah!

47
00:03:21,219 --> 00:03:23,219
Aha! From the mountain you can come.

48
00:03:26,219 --> 00:03:28,219
Do you fly then?

49
00:03:28,219 --> 00:03:31,219
Yeah, I'm not a backpack from the top now.

50
00:03:57,219 --> 00:03:59,219
That's why it's so long.

51
00:03:59,219 --> 00:04:01,219
You are groaning to sink.

52
00:04:01,219 --> 00:04:02,219
Tähden.

53
00:04:02,219 --> 00:04:06,219
What if we go south, with this?

54
00:04:06,219 --> 00:04:07,219
So.

55
00:04:07,219 --> 00:04:09,219
I was thinking about going.

56
00:04:09,219 --> 00:04:11,219
Let's see is.

57
00:04:11,219 --> 00:04:14,219
It's so long.

58
00:04:14,219 --> 00:04:16,220
That's why it's so long.

59
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:18,220
You are groaning to sink.

60
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:20,220
Tähden.

61
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:23,220
It's what if you go south to the south.

62
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:24,220
This is what.

63
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:25,220
So.

64
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:28,220
I was thinking about going on a long journey before the table.

65
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:30,220
I was really.

66
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:31,220
I was.

67
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:32,220
I was.

68
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:33,220
Come on.

69
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:34,220
I was.

70
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:36,220
Thanks to the trips should be slow and long.

71
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:38,220
I like the foot.

72
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:47,220
Form, Veikko!

73
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:49,220
Aliisa.

74
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:51,220
Where to Lentvehjo?

75
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:52,220
In the air.

76
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:54,220
And the murmur is a passenger.

77
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:57,220
Ask Niiskulta you got to fly too.

78
00:04:57,220 --> 00:05:00,220
I would like to go more closely, but ...

79
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:01,220
I?

80
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:02,220
Are you debt?

81
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:04,220
It's not the cause.

82
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:08,220
But we mumbled my no permit.

83
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:12,220
And not the bone that Veli's aircraft is demanding.

84
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:13,220
Probably not.

85
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:15,220
Grandma's old.

86
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:18,220
He is the witchcraft to fly with a broom.

87
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:21,220
Do you have to tell Mummy?

88
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:24,220
No, now you come without a gas!

89
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:26,220
Oh!

90
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:28,220
Oh!

91
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:30,220
!

92
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:31,220
No!

93
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:35,220
What permits?

94
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:38,220
Oh!

95
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:47,220
I have to get to fly must!

96
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:50,220
Grandma!

97
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:52,220
Grandma!

98
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:54,220
It would be nice!

99
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:56,220
You're not!

100
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:58,220
You're not!

101
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:00,220
No!

102
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:02,220
No!

103
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:04,220
No!

104
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:06,220
No!

105
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:08,220
No!

106
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:10,220
No!

107
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:12,220
Grandma!

108
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:14,220
No!

109
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:16,220
No!

110
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:17,220
No!

111
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:20,220
You don't know ain't ask!

112
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:23,220
You know and the answer is no!

113
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:26,220
I would like to fly the air on the ship?

114
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:28,220
No!

115
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:31,220
Niiniskun said I was welcome at any time!

116
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:33,220
You're not smmi!

117
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:36,220
Yeah, but the rest of the way!

118
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:39,220
Don't try to love me!

119
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:41,220
No concept! Why not get flying?

120
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:43,220
I've already got why!

121
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:45,220
So but when ...

122
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:49,220
We are witches!

123
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:54,220
I started with Epää, the Kosinus will continue our glorious witchcraft and ...

124
00:06:54,220 --> 00:07:00,220
The edition we would go to their grave if I knew as I knew that I had another broom!

125
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:02,220
But...

126
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:04,220
ALSSI is the end of the process!

127
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:06,220
We wake up water!

128
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:10,220
I don't hear what answers!

129
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:12,220
Yeah!

130
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:18,220
Listen to get lifa!

131
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:23,220
I think about you with your first entry in your witchcraft!

132
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:30,220
Where is one far from the south in the warm club to wait for your bone there!

133
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:33,220
My bone!

134
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:35,220
You mean!

135
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:37,220
I mean, I mean!

136
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:39,220
If you have a whiskey!

137
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:42,220
You mean!

138
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:45,220
I mean, I mean!

139
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:51,220
If you have a whisker right, learn to adopt a quick gypsy!

140
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:53,220
Past!

141
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:55,220
We're right!

142
00:07:56,220 --> 00:08:00,220
Well, you won't go for a walking vision water!

143
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:02,220
Yeah!

144
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:13,220
May the desire to be controlled.

145
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:15,220
I'll let me even try.

146
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:17,220
You've been losing every dasty.

147
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:21,220
I know I know, but it's not at all the same as guidance.

148
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:23,220
So I didn't know the spring.

149
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:25,220
Do you say what you said?

150
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:31,220
The air would be better than the witch's bone because anyone can stick to its controllers.

151
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:35,220
You don't have to be witch.

152
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:39,220
If so, why is this this time trying?

153
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:41,220
I come back from the desire to guide.

154
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:45,220
So, why is this a fashion troll trying?

155
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:47,220
It's dangerous.

156
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:49,220
Oh!

157
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:51,220
I don't know to Kärmu.

158
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:53,220
Then at the beginning like a witch's bone.

159
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:57,220
It is not, but the air platforms and tackle expertly.

160
00:08:57,220 --> 00:09:01,220
I know how to teach me first.

161
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:03,220
So is it if you get permission from home?

162
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:05,220
You can thank you Niisku!

163
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:07,220
Oops!

164
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:11,220
Well. Then, somewhere at home, permission?

165
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:13,220
You can thank you Niisku!

166
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:15,220
Huh ...

167
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:25,220
Oops!

168
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:27,220
Oops!

169
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:29,220
Oops!

170
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:34,220
Oh, hui good, miracle. I have to go to me.

171
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:44,220
Mise else?

172
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:46,220
That's the expense.

173
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:54,220
For winter arrival.

174
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:55,220
So.

175
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:58,220
I am still against it.

176
00:09:58,220 --> 00:10:00,220
Oh against winter?

177
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:04,220
Not when against the rest of the mite of the flight alone.

178
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:07,220
It didn't say that before.

179
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:10,220
Not when the boy was so happy.

180
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:14,220
And I think he is one of the rejoicing flight.

181
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:16,220
You are dangerous.

182
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:17,220
And from yppis.

183
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:18,220
What?

184
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:21,220
If so, we can do our boy.

185
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:24,220
But that's what the air ship is invented.

186
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:26,220
Do not rush.

187
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:28,220
It doesn't do good to the heart.

188
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:32,220
We must no longer treat the mine other than the little one.

189
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:49,220
Now you know what the lights of what the light means.

190
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:53,220
So I know this I went quickly Do you know how to guide you.

191
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:55,220
In theory, at least.

192
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:59,220
So when we don't get up, it goes a little sad.

193
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:01,220
Other mite.

194
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:04,220
I'm a look.

195
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:08,220
Yeah, dare, I'm going to take it here.

196
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:10,220
Well, so.

197
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:12,220
Good is the start of the motor.

198
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:13,220
Yeah.

199
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:19,220
Oh!

200
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:20,220
Oh!

201
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:24,220
Fully forward.

202
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:25,220
Yeah!

203
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:42,220
Now you can top the top relaxed.

204
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:44,220
Yeah.

205
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:46,220
Now.

206
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:48,220
And then up to the germination.

207
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:53,220
Wedding!

208
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:57,220
Wedding!

209
00:11:57,220 --> 00:11:59,220
That's what it is!

210
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:05,220
That's what we fly, we fly.

211
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:08,220
For la it, this is a flight of Veikot.

212
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:12,220
I spoke fast.

213
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:24,220
The wedding is a heum in the troll now harshly or air from you.

214
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:26,220
I can.

215
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:28,220
Pot the action is very learning.

216
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:30,220
Well, you heard from the priest.

217
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:33,220
I said you are restless.

218
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:38,220
Now I'm looking forward to a clear and calm day alone for my flight.

219
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:40,220
Isn't that a spawn?

220
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:42,220
No, Tarotka you fly.

221
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:44,220
Flows me.

222
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:46,220
Came sinny very happy,

223
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:50,220
But when the mass is already fetched at the time,

224
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:53,220
From where I can come to the passenger.

225
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:56,220
Come on, Mom?

226
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:57,220
Tua.

227
00:12:57,220 --> 00:12:59,220
She can't get her mother join.

228
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:02,220
And better if not.

229
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:03,220
Why?

230
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:08,220
Låt when you tier the air the ship is not spoiled anyway.

231
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:14,220
The hall circled the expression that the mummy was quite heavy.

232
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:15,220
Oh so.

233
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:19,220
No, no I mean you as a mummy, somewhere,

234
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:23,220
when just as much but the Moomintroll is quite students

235
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:26,220
And it's easier to fly if you have less weight.

236
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:28,220
Don't be afraid of the nipple.

237
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:31,220
I did not illustrate my departure,

238
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:33,220
where somehow makes it difficult to air.

239
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:34,220
I have a disappointment.

240
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:37,220
Then I fly alone.

241
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:41,220
Moomintroll, maybe you can tie me along.

242
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:43,220
I'm pretty light.

243
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:44,220
That's when not ti.

244
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:46,220
Then.

245
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:49,220
You can fly with me.

246
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:51,220
Why?

247
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:55,220
If you are, in my opinion, that the Moomintroll will be able to fly alone on your start,

248
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:57,220
I guess I can join.

249
00:13:57,220 --> 00:14:01,220
Well it's probably that the Moomintroll can fly.

250
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:04,220
It is clear, we can leave.

251
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:05,220
This is what I guess.

252
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:07,220
I'm glad to come.

253
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:09,220
The chair hit.

254
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:15,220
Well, fly the Moomintroll.

255
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:18,220
Well, fly the Moomintroll.

256
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:27,220
Oh!

257
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:37,220
Oh!

258
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:42,220
Oh!

259
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:45,220
Fairytale, Moomintroll.

260
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:46,220
Oh!

261
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:49,220
How fun you enjoy flying?

262
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:52,220
What do I thieves in the wooden jam?

263
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:56,220
Vassin to see.

264
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:59,220
The rise became more difficult because you climbed.

265
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:01,220
I'm so heavy.

266
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:03,220
So when I'm in you in your skills.

267
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:07,220
That's when you said that the alternation is a delicate boring weight.

268
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:09,220
However, the lending seems to be going smoothly.

269
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:11,220
Well, Anda go.

270
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:13,220
To the chair.

271
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:16,220
The rising of the giggles told me that there was Gaun.

272
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:31,220
I'm just arriving.

273
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:33,220
I am gaming.

274
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:35,220
This is just right!

275
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:38,220
Or!

276
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:51,220
We back to that that.

277
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:54,220
This is what the stage is, let's get closer.

278
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:57,220
No, it's too wealthy.

279
00:15:57,220 --> 00:16:01,220
Kenki Moomintroll is going to see what?

280
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:04,220
No, you can find the panties!

281
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:07,220
Here is playing, in chair.

282
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:09,220
What do you play, Masinaut?

283
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:24,220
Opa skabala chair.

284
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:34,220
Are you kungu?

285
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:40,220
Oh!

286
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:43,220
Stuck, it's Moomintroll.

287
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:57,220
Fortunately, no more damage was caused.

288
00:16:57,220 --> 00:16:59,220
I'm terribly evil, yes.

289
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:01,220
Pulus came as a surprise I did not.

290
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:05,220
My week when Kunnen remembered to tell you came from the dangers of the year.

291
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:07,220
I too forgot to warn.

292
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:10,220
You said you were going on a long journey.

293
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:12,220
Do you get the ship in order?

294
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:14,220
No, I can.

295
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:16,220
Don't you tell me what?

296
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:17,220
I don't.

297
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:19,220
Why didn't you tell you?

298
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:23,220
Well I would, he soon told.

299
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:26,220
Oh, I thought nothing.

300
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:29,220
Well now he knows, so when not ti.

301
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:32,220
I get a very long journey before the winter.

302
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:35,220
Return in the spring I wintered with the rest of us.

303
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:37,220
Why do you bring me?

304
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:39,220
I would come.

305
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:42,220
Forgive or you need a lot of luggage.

306
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:44,220
There is not enough space for passengers.

307
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:50,220
But that's what I promise to have everything on the next ships.

308
00:17:57,220 --> 00:17:58,220
Oh ...

309
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:07,220
Winter was really coming.

310
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:12,220
After a dealer, the rest of the other in Mulaakso was snowing all the way to the Blue Fores.

311
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:16,220
At that time, the Moomin for Family Conduct.

312
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:20,220
See you again in the spring.

313
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:21,220
Yeah!

314
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:25,220
You have then completely learned to the witch's guide.

315
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:27,220
I try my vow.

316
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:30,220
Hi hey muli!

317
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:32,220
Hi, do you go anywhere?

318
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:36,220
I'm leaving myself!

319
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:38,220
With Vomo, those witch!

320
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:40,220
I hope you get the whiskers.

321
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:43,220
I bring it to be all the rare plants I find.

322
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:46,220
Thank you, it's hearty.

323
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:48,220
Goodbye to the form, Pappa!

324
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:49,220
Goodbye!

325
00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:51,220
Goodbye to form, mom!

326
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:53,220
For butter!

327
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:55,220
Is a neama!

328
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:56,220
Hm?

329
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:05,220
I heard that a theme trip to Niisku.

330
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:07,220
For a long journey.

331
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:10,220
Other mousse valleys completely empty.

332
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:17,220
Oh!

333
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:20,220
Tax nivu!

334
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:23,220
Below is a theme, let's get out.

335
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:25,220
Is it?

336
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:43,220
Oh!

337
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:20,220
Oh!

338
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:35,220
Nuska, lumpy!

339
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:44,220
Now you leave.

340
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:46,220
So.

341
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:48,220
I would have struggled to come as a way.

342
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:51,220
I know, but I have to leave alone.

343
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:54,220
I just get goodbye to Senoma.

344
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:56,220
Goodbye then.

345
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:58,220
Are you going back in the spring?

346
00:20:58,220 --> 00:21:00,220
Of course, as always.

347
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:09,220
Is that for me?

348
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:12,220
Woodworm Harporal Your Arvo Cain's property therefore.

349
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:14,220
That's why I'll give it yours.

350
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:17,220
Calls it like a boredom with me.

351
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:21,220
I call often.

352
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:28,220
I don't have to rush.

353
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:30,220
It's already raining Lunda.

354
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:32,220
Farewell nuska lumpy.

355
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:44,220
Farewell nuska lumpy.

356
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:14,220
Now you again in the spring.

357
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:44,220
Now you again in the spring.

358
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:51,220
Moomin valley in our troll.

359
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:54,220
And the rest, they will sleep.

360
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:57,220
Have a nice day until Mäinen's day.
