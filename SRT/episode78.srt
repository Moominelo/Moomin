He can fly where the mind is doing.

23
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:07,000
The only subject of sadness is that only one passenger can accommodate.

24
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Niisku Widbecue is wonderful to fly!

25
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
so I do.

26
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Nipsu doesn't want to have another flight!

27
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
no.

28
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Nipsu you had misfortune. That day was a fierce breeze. Niisku was afraid.

29
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
It was terrible. At least the hurricane and it still rained.

30
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Aapua! Aap!

31
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Don't go, you can control the bump!

32
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Nipsu, you bother.

33
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Niisku descend! Lower right away!

34
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Put me to guide!

35
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Nisku for the denial was afraid of wind and rain, but even more nips.

36
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:01,000
How could the nipple have landed if you prevented him from guiding?

37
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Well I don't know. I'm not a lecture.

38
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
good at least that you were happy to get to the ground.

39
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Yes, Nisku has built a great ship.

40
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
True!

41
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
We have a slipping flight weather today.

42
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
So.

43
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Aha, the mountain doubles smoke.

44
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Do you fly then?

45
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Yeah, I haven't seen the mountain from above.

46
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Yes.

47
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Autumn is so beautiful.

48
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I guess you will soon go south.

49
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I'm leaving.

50
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Listen, what if I went south by flying?

51
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Is this?

52
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Yes. I was thinking of going a long journey before winter.

53
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Are you really?

54
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I'm, I am. Come along.

55
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Thank you. Traveling should be slow and long.

56
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I like the walk.

57
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Form -troll!

58
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Alisa!

59
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Where is the Airporte?

60
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
in the air. And Muikkunen is a passenger.

61
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I ask Niiskula Can you fly?

62
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
After all, I would like to, but ...

63
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Do you just be?

64
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
It's not the reason.

65
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,000
But Grandma says I'm not allowed to fly.

66
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,000
And I guess he doesn't think the brother's air is dangerous.

67
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
probably not.

68
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Grandma is old.

69
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
In his opinion, witches must fly with a broom.

70
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Do you have to tell Grandma?

71
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Hi, now they come back!

72
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Hoi!

73
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Hoi!

74
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Visit!

75
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
How gorgeous!

76
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Hoi!

77
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I have to fly.

78
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Let's go!

79
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
supposedly now?

80
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
grandma, can I ...

81
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
et.

82
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
doesn't know what I was asking for.

83
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I know this and the answer no.

84
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
I would like to fly the air on the board.

85
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
No.

86
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Niiskun said I was welcome at any time.

87
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
You won't go.

88
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Yeah, but grandma gold.

89
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Don't try to please me.

90
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I don't understand why not go flying?

91
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I've already said why.

92
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
so but when ...

93
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
We are those jars.

94
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I have begun to see if you will be a glorious sequel to our family.

95
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Our ESI -Mother would turn in her tomb if you knew you were flying with a non -broom.

96
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
But ...

97
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,000
The matter has been dealt with. Go get water.

98
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
I don't hear what you answered.

99
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Yeah.

100
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Listen, Salisa.

101
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:27,000
I have been thinking about taking you after the first snow came to the cave.

102
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Where is that?

103
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Far in the south, in a warm region. Your bone is waiting there.

104
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:42,000
my bone? You mean ...

105
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I mean, if you are studying very hard, you can learn to fly faster than you believe.

106
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,000
AI, thank you.

107
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
No weather from those countries.

108
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Well, go now to get some water from the well.

109
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Yeah.

110
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
or you want to control?

111
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Let me even try.

112
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
You have already flown twice.

113
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:25,000
I know, I know, but it's not at all the same as guidance.

114
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Yes, of course.

115
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Do you remember what you said? Your aircraft is better than a witch's bone because anyone can stick to its controllers.

116
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
No need to be witch.

117
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
If that is, why don't you let me try?

118
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
a piece of desire to control.

119
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Niisku, why don't you let my Moomintroll try?

120
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
It is dangerous.

121
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
ai.

122
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Of course, not to me.

123
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Then at the beginning is like a witch's bone.

124
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:01,000
and there is no, but the aircraft must be treated with sensitivity.

125
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:05,000
I can, Niisku, as long as you teach me first.

126
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Well, be it if you get permission from home.

127
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Thank you, Niisku.

128
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Oh good miracle. Do you have to go ahead now?

129
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
What is the Moomintroll?

130
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
by Niisku.

131
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Winter makes its way.

132
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Yes.

133
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I'm still against it.

134
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
AI against winter.

135
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Not when the Moomintroll flies alone.

136
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
You haven't said it before.

137
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Not when the boy was so joyful.

138
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,000
And I think he is still rejoiced at the upcoming flight.

139
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
It is dangerous.

140
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
and Ã–ps.

141
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
What?

142
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
If Niisku knows, we can.

143
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
But Niisku is inventing the aircraft.

144
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Don't accelerate, priest. It doesn't do good for the heart.

145
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,000
We must no longer treat the Moomintroll like a little one.

146
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Yes.

147
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
You know what the light and lever means.

148
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
I know.

149
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
This was fast. Can you control?

150
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
in theory at least.

151
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Niiskun. We rise. Go a little more discriminatory.

152
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Direct the Moomintroll?

153
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
en.

154
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
here where you fly.

155
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Don't be afraid. I am here to take.

156
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Travel, Niisku.

157
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Good. Start the engine.

158
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Yeah.

159
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
in full front.

160
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Yeah.

161
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Now you can take more relaxed.

162
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Yeah.

163
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Well so. And then up slowly.

164
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Don't take it.

165
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Niisku, we fly. We fly.

166
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
It is clear. This is the aircraft.

167
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Oh how gorgeous.

168
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:24,000
or that the Moomintroll can now control your aircraft.

169
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
part. Your son is very educational.

170
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Well, you heard from the priest. I said you were unnecessarily restless.

171
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Now I am looking for a clear and calm day alone for my flight.

172
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Doesn't the nipple come along?

173
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
No. Do you disease to fly?

174
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Who? Am I? I'd love to come, but when my mass is recently.

175
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
If you want a passenger, I can come.

176
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Would you come, mother?

177
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
that ...

178
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Hi, let me get involved.

179
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Share, better if not.

180
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Why?

181
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Ware when you know, my aircraft is not spoiled and otherwise.

182
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,000
It was a circulation that Mumimama is too heavy.

183
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Vainii.

184
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:26,000
No, no. So I mean, the Moomin priest weighs quite a bit, but the Moomintroll is still a student and it is easier to fly if there is less weight.

185
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Don't be afraid, Niisku. I do not illustrate that I will go with it if it somehow makes it difficult to airplane.

186
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
I'm sorry.

187
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Well, then I fly alone.

188
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Moomintroll, maybe you could take me with me. I'm pretty light.

189
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Mom of the Nap.

190
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
No, then.

191
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,000
You can fly with me.

192
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Why?

193
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:57,000
If you think that the Moomintroll can fly alone, I guess I can go.

194
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Well it is certain that the Moomintroll can fly.

195
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,000
is clear. We can leave.

196
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Tattakai. I'm glad you will come.

197
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
There will be a rise.

198
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Moomintroll, let's go.

199
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Moomintroll, let's go.

200
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Moomintroll, let's go.

201
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Moomintroll, let's go.

202
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,000
How fun you enjoy flying.

203
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,000
What did you bake at the beginning?

204
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
or you here?

205
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
The rise became more difficult because you climbed.

206
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:03,000
I when I'm so heavy what is you in your only?

207
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Niiskun said that the ship was sensitive to extra weight.

208
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,000
to the volcano. Nuska Muikkunen said it was beautiful there.

209
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
There will be other things.

210
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Is there an asset, smoke? Do I have to play?

211
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
This is not right.

212
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
This is dangerous.

213
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,000
must melt lava. Let's fly closer.

214
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,000
No, it's too dangerous.

215
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:01,000
fix Moomintroll. Let's go back.

216
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
And don't turn, Janis pants.

217
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Here you have to play a volcano for your attempt.

218
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,000
What is scary about it?

219
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
will be the rest of the other.

220
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Is there a volcano?

221
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Are you okay?

222
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Rush Moomintroll.

223
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
volcano.

224
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
I'm terribly sorry.

225
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Suddenly came.

226
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:05,000
My fault Kunnen remembered to tell you about the dangers of the volcano.

227
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
I too forgot to warn.

228
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,000
You said you were going on a long journey.

229
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Do you get the ship in order?

230
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
I wonder if I can.

231
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
And you haven't told me anything?

232
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
en.

233
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Why haven't you told?

234
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,000
I would have told you soon.

235
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
I thought.

236
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
It's nothing.

237
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Now you know, neck.

238
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:33,000
I will go very well before winter comes.

239
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,000
I return to the spring in the Moomins.

240
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Why don't you bring me with you?

241
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
I would come.

242
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Sorry but I need a lot of luggage.

243
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
There is not enough space for passengers.

244
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:51,000
But that's what I promise you will fit everyone on the next ship.

245
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Winter was really coming.

246
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:13,000
After the Academe, there would be snow in the Moomin Valley.

247
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:17,000
At that time, the Moomin family goes to winter.

248
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,000
will then be seen again in the spring.

249
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Yeah.

250
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,000
You have then completely learned those when we meet.

251
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
I will try my best.

252
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Hi Hemuli!

253
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Hi, do you go somewhere?

254
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:38,000
I'm going south. With the rest of the witch in the cave.

255
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Hope to enjoy.

256
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:44,000
I bring you all the rare plants I can find.

257
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Thank you. It's hearty.

258
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Goodbye Moomin Papa!

259
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Goodbye.

260
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Goodbye Moominmamma!

261
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Oh very well.

262
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Good luck!

263
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:06,000
I heard that Niiskuk would go on a journey.

264
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
for a long journey.

265
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,000
The Moomin Lay is stuck.

266
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Oops!

267
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
It's Niisku!

268
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,000
He leaves for many months.

269
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Can you?

270
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
haa!

271
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Nuska Muikkuinen!

272
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
haa!

273
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Now you are sources.

274
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Yes.

275
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,000
I would have liked to come in.

276
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,000
I know, but I have to go alone.

277
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,000
I just came to say, goodbye.

278
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
goodbye then.

279
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Do you return again in the spring?

280
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
of course, as always.

281
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Is it for me?

282
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
is.

283
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Wood meat is the most valuable property, SIK.

284
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
That's why I give it to you.

285
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Call it when you miss me.

286
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
I call often.

287
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Now I have to rush.

288
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
it is already snowing.

289
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Good following.

290
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
I still have.

291
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
it is already raining.

292
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Goodbye, snus Muikkunen.

293
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Goodbye, snus Muikkunen.

294
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Goodbye, snus Muikkunen.

295
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Moomin lashes snow.

296
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Moomin lays snow.

297
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Moomins fell asleep ...

298
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:58,000
fell asleep until the first day of the spring.
