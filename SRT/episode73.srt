If you are going to go right now, you should get to the island.

23
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
What if the water rises when we are halfway?

24
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Nepsu, it doesn't work so fast. We are going back on the journey in good time.

25
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
But how do we know what's in good time?

26
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Do not, murdered. When it's time to come back, I will let you know a decent bun with PUM.

27
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
You even hear it there on a distant beach.

28
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Is it quite strong?

29
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Hi then!

30
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Have fun!

31
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Take care of my sister!

32
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
fool! I can take care of myself.

33
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Too difficult.

34
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Nepsu, come already!

35
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
What about you?

36
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I'm absolutely worried.

37
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
haa ...

38
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
What's wrong with you? Now you are not worried.

39
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,000
What if the tide is still rolling in our neck?

40
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Do you like a stupid life jacket?

41
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,000
The rising water follows the moon, and you never know where it is on the way.

42
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Nepsu, you are incredible! Are you not interested in the Aare Bear buried on the island?

43
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
ooo, aare?

44
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
did not hear or?

45
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
oops ...

46
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Oh a round island!

47
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I know. The water has already fallen. Let's race on the island. Y, ka, ku, ny!

48
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Muvi, Pekko, you stole.

49
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I'm not even yeah!

50
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
It's a rook!

51
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Don't laugh at me!

52
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000

53
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000

54
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Pekko?

55
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Oh, you look at how Somi saw and I found.

56
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Yeah, they are beautiful. Especially that shoe.

57
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Then you get it.

58
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Oh, please.

59
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Ah, cheer, I asked it.

60
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Look, nipple, real octopus.

61
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Yeah.

62
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Nipsu, what do you stand there for it?

63
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I watch the sea so that it doesn't slip into our neck.

64
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,000
You're nothing about it in these, idiat.

65
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I'm going to look for a better observation place.

66
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Nipsu!

67
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Stay!

68
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,000
here at least I can't see anything.

69
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Ah, I see in the rock in every direction.

70
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Kallio departure.

71
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
heavy stones.

72
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
oops.

73
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
haa, real amethysts.

74
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Where am I?

75
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
oh.

76
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
haa.

77
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,000
oh how beautiful and valuable.

78
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
and how much.

79
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
haa.

80
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Happiness.

81
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I got it.

82
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Aaaaa!

83
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
butter.

84
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Do you think these are a little enough?

85
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Yeah, thank you.

86
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
What are you doing?

87
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Don't you see? We build a hut. Come and help.

88
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:54,000
The hut is too small for all of us what the officials have.

89
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,000
strange, I haven't seen nips at all.

90
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Nothing. It's quite peaceful.

91
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Let's go nipsua.

92
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
strange. Hoi Nipsu.

93
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Nipsuu.

94
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
He has left home alone.

95
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,000
not. He would have said. Nipsu, Hoi, where are you?

96
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
came with rain.

97
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
about.

98
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
The clock is now uniform.

99
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
aha.

100
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I want to see how it works.

101
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:37,000
It works well. I have designed it to launch my aircraft.

102
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Well, block your ear.

103
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
hmm.

104
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
block your ear.

105
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
hmm.

106
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
oops.

107
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Niisku.

108
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
I did not take the rain in mind.

109
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Nipsuu.

110
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Nipsuu, where are you?

111
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
You come here.

112
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Where has he faded?

113
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
The water has begun to rise again.

114
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Oops, help, help, boom truck!

115
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Water has entered.

116
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
aha.

117
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Water has entered.

118
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
aha.

119
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Water has entered.

120
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Water has entered.

121
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
aha.

122
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
I have found an amethyst cave.

123
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
What a lucky kick.

124
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
It is more companion than a treasure chest.

125
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
oops.

126
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
How did I get out of here?

127
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Boum troll!

128
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Oh! Help, help!

129
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:07,000
I would have thought the nipple knows that the gun will get wet in Satella.

130
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,000
I didn't expect rain. Let's keep busy and have time to have the island.

131
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,000
is currently in full moon and high tide is particularly high.

132
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
miserable!

133
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Nipsuu!

134
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Nipsuu! Where are you?

135
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Nipsuu!

136
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Listen!

137
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Have you found a nipple?

138
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
The water is so high that we can get back.

139
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
What?

140
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
We are in Uka.

141
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Good gentleman VÃ¤kin!

142
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Niisku would like to bump when we have time to return.

143
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
But the sea is going to us.

144
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
The construction of the cabin was not a crazy idea after all.

145
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Nipsu must be found.

146
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Yes.

147
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Nipsuu!

148
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Nipsuu!

149
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
water flows.

150
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
If the water gets in, I'll get out.

151
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Umi, we cannot get to the island during high tide.

152
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
We need to come up with something else.

153
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,000
We need to come up with something else.

154
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
We need to come up with something else.

155
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
We need to come up with something else.

156
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
We get to the island.

157
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Only rushes.

158
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Moomin Bapp, nothing will come.

159
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
You come up with something?

160
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
The current seems to increase.

161
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Cave mouth, rescue.

162
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Amethyst!

163
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Moomintroll, come and help!

164
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
I think it sounded like a nipple sound.

165
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
I didn't hear.

166
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Moomintroll!

167
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Nipsu, where are you?

168
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Moomintroll, help!

169
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Moomintroll, Come and help!

170
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
The sound comes from the cave.

171
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Nipsu!

172
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,000
How have we got there?

173
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,000
It's not important. Help out!

174
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,000
to get your stops.

175
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
What are you doing?

176
00:14:24,000 --> 02:11:07,000
Tentuu.

177
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
The books have experience.

178
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,000
I am starving.

179
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Did you have something to bite in the snack basket?

180
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,000
stayed. Leave the scraps by a campfire.

181
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,000
The Moomintroll has first made fire.

182
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,000
finally sells to collect dry leaves.

183
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,000
clear. Nipsu, you will help me?

184
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,000
and not. I will return to the cave to get more amethytes.

185
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000
There is no time for it. You help or I eat your part.

186
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Even so.

187
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,000
him!

188
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Is there anything about it?

189
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Well, no.

190
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,000
I have wanted.

191
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Is there anything about it?

192
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,000
surely.

193
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,000
According to my calculations, I was able to fly here to the island.

194
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,000
When I get to the island, I pull the boat there.

195
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,000
The plan cannot fail to swear by it.

196
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Good.

197
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Now I'm leaving.

198
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Continue, continue!

199
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Crash the wings!

200
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,000
on PiemÃ¤lÃ¤ Island.

201
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,000
This works as I am planned.

202
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,000
If I have not misjudged my own forces.

203
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Good.

204
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,000
I have reached the island.

205
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
I have reached the island.

206
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,000
I have reached the island.

207
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
tel!

208
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Don't be pampered, niisku!

209
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Don't fall!

210
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Don't Wood ...

211
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Help!

212
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Niisku, are you okay?

213
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Yes ... I guess.

214
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Thanks to the help, Muikkunen.

215
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,000
can't stand what you are flying here in the middle of the night.

216
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,000
The Moomintroll and partners are on the island in their own Onnesa ditch.

217
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,000
by water.

218
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,000
We have tried to save them without success.

219
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Oh in that way.

220
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Wait in peace for the next low water.

221
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,000
I am sure they will find some rain protection.

222
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,000
hopefully.

223
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,000
It's not cold now.

224
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,000
They have previously spent the night under the bare sky.

225
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Well, so.

226
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Stocky tuned water.

227
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,000
hmm ... Nous, Muikkunen.

228
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,000
What are you moving?

229
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,000
I came to see the round island.

230
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Incredible, you can see.

231
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,000
In the event that the fog is a little blurred.

232
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,000
What sound was it?

233
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,000
somewhere rolled over.

234
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,000
The roar is roaring!

235
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,000
And no sound is under the ground.

236
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:19,000
í¬ê²

237
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,000
What was it?

238
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
The country was shy.

239
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Do you shy?

240
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Well, Pekka!

241
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
The sound comes from here.

242
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Don't go there, you have to danger.

243
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Wait for me.

244
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
The sound is near.

245
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Hattuots.

246
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Hattavatit competes. They have fun.

247
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
What was it?

248
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
oh!

249
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,000
oh! We are going to sleep.

250
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
What about Hattivat?

251
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
have certainly left.

252
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
The water drops.

253
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
We get home. Hurrah!

254
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
oops!

255
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
snus Muikkunen!

256
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Muikkunen!

257
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Muikkunen!

258
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Muikkunen!

259
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Muikkunen!

260
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Muikkunen!

261
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Muikkunen!

262
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Muikkunen!

263
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Father!

264
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
and nap!

265
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Dad doesn't wake up!

266
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
NIisku, what is you?

267
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
is! Now it's morning!

268
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Moomintroll!

269
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
sister, why are you here?

270
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Moomintroll, is all well?

271
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
You didn't cold in the rain?

272
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Of course I don't.

273
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Yeah, blow. I brought you beautiful shoes.

274
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Thank you.

275
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
look at this.

276
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
What a beautiful one. Amethyst right?

277
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:21,000
That's right. I had many amethysts, but they fell into the water.

278
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Sometimes we start to get them.

279
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:27,000
and we see something extraordinarily beautiful on the island.

280
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Share. Let's go home. Mamma is definitely worried.

281
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Let's leave!

282
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
What? What?

283
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Stay after!

284
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Moomintroll, you are cold.

285
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:47,000
And you look tired, good police officer.

286
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Let's go for a drink. You too, naisku.

287
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Yeah.

288
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Thank you.
