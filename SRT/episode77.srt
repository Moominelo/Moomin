Hi!

17
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Why do you answer?

18
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
huh?

19
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Oh!

20
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Hi!

21
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Hi!

22
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Hi!

23
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Hi!

24
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Hi!

25
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Hi!

26
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Hi!

27
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Hi!

28
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Hi!

29
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Hi!

30
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Hi!

31
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Hi!

32
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Isku, Miss!

33
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
How are you going?

34
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
to watch Momi, Pekka.

35
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Well it's not new.

36
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Nonsense to run after.

37
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
No, something has happened.

38
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Hi!

39
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Oh you!

40
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Well what is it now?

41
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Niisku finally tries on the aircraft.

42
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Did you?

43
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Yes, it is a good time to see, even though you walk a little slower.

44
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Why are everyone running?

45
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
They went to help the sting.

46
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:52,000
You still need to disassemble the tent around the aircraft and the ball is full of gas.

47
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Well pull now!

48
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Hi!

49
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
The aircraft is finally completed.

50
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Does it look strange?

51
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Well, no gas has been blown there yet.

52
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Now the ball is perfect with gas that is much lighter than the air.

53
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,000
and when the ship is in the air, it is controlled by this propeller.

54
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Niisku -lady begins.

55
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
clear!

56
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Grandma, Mamma and Nuska, can they hurry?

57
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Oops, here you start to be ready.

58
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Thank you for coming, good friends.

59
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Soon my ship will rise to air like a swan.

60
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Know that it even flies to the wind.

61
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Thank you, please, please.

62
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Look!

63
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
What is there?

64
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
What is there?

65
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Another aircraft!

66
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Not quite a flying basket!

67
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Well Johan now, someone has stolen the invention of the nap.

68
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Oh oh, this is not true.

69
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Good day, gentlemen. Do you remember me?

70
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I came again for a visit.

71
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Yes, we Mr. Big Remember. Who could forget.

72
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Last time he skied.

73
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
and ate all the jam from us.

74
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:04,000
We had such a lot of fun last winter that you have definitely missed me.

75
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Do you still have jam? I'll come there as soon as I calculated.

76
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,000
And I was sure I was the first.

77
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Oh abomination!

78
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,000
The ball became too full.

79
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Niisku!

80
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
It's hard right now.

81
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Don't worry, the brisk and Hemul's ship is just a silly basket.

82
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
The vessel is not much strange.

83
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Compass, you are just this one now.

84
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I would like to first see how this ship flies.

85
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I go to see it another glee.

86
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I will come along.

87
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I am also interested in the guest intentions.

88
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
We should be inspected by the ship.

89
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
juuh.

90
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Days, Little Sell.

91
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
We came to see the fly, your basket.

92
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
How is it flying?

93
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
How?

94
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Well does it win?

95
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Of course it wins.

96
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
The air on the ship is the engine.

97
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I believe it wins the racing flight.

98
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
like that? How hard does it fly?

99
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Hard to say.

100
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
It's nice.

101
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I'm still still still still.

102
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
How hard does it fly?

103
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
It's hard to say when it hasn't flown yet.

104
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
gas leaked out.

105
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
haa, other lollipop.

106
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Hemme was waiting for it so early.

107
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Winter has not yet come.

108
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Has it stopped skiing?

109
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Hemul's laundry basket loses the air on my ship.

110
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Of course, Niisku.

111
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
It is to take the wind.

112
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
You can go in any direction.

113
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
and even fly into the wind.

114
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
After all.

115
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Just right.

116
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Rapid in the beginning.

117
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I find it unfair that the stranger of the reigns arrive on my first day of flight.

118
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
This jam is great.

119
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
That's why I really came.

120
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
It still remained in the basement.

121
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Even I can't do any more.

122
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Good it is, Moominmamma.

123
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Thanks for the courtesy.

124
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Maybe you want to jam?

125
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I waited a little bit.

126
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
As much as you need from you.

127
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
The jam is a hooded pancake flower.

128
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
and he is fun.

129
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I would see some flying window.

130
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
oh, extract.

131
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Would he have got his aircraft in order?

132
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
No, the pilot was probably witch.

133
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Witch it.

134
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
He always knocks on the door with bone.

135
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Moominum, why don't you knock on it?

136
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
because I am alone alone alone.

137
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Days, this surprise.

138
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:28,000
The day I see a strange flying device that must have landed on the puzzle.

139
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
True, the pilot sits here.

140
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Oops, right witch.

141
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Daddy right, and when I fly, I fly on the right broom.

142
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Old early grandmother.

143
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Must go with development, and the development is to fly with vehicles that can be built.

144
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I make the broom myself in five minutes.

145
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
It is certainly uncomfortable to sit down on the broom.

146
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Someone seems to have built the right air device here.

147
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
It has not flown yet.

148
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
But my ship is.

149
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:12,000
You also allow you to say that there is the right broom along the broom.

150
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
and not Lenne.

151
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Yes, it will fly. Besides, only witches can fly with broom.

152
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Well, do you compete?

153
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
How?

154
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:26,000
I fly my bone on the back and you in your flying laundry basket.

155
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Good. I will respond to the challenge.

156
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
How do we do?

157
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
We choose our amount from there.

158
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:40,000
And then, when we were, we could go.

159
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,000
We choose our amount from there and return.

160
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Well and where are we heading?

161
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Moomin priest, do you have suggestions?

162
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:54,000
mmm, that ... What do you think, snus Muikkunen?

163
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Was the peak of the lonely mountains?

164
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Yeah, it's great more to be.

165
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Hemuli hear, do you know anyone who grows up there?

166
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:10,000
At the top, a star -shaped white flower grows, and there is no lower one.

167
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
the one who first brings who wins.

168
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
and the winner I am.

169
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I'm going to win in the air competition.

170
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
You can, I always win.

171
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Do not allow the ropes before I give permission?

172
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
No, no, trust us.

173
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:39,000
and then this. Hemuli, don't let go.

174
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Grandma, do you definitely win?

175
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,000
After all, I'm a witch. I win, silly.

176
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Don't know it. Hemuli, a brilliant, seems so truly safe.

177
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
It might be embarrassing for you if it happens ...

178
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
The brutal is embarrassed here, and no one else.

179
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
with noi, I'm ready. Vent the witch.

180
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
I'm ready, toope.

181
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Don't get angry if you lose.

182
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Remember that participation is important, not profit.

183
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I will show you the loss.

184
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Good. Lonely mountains. Loose.

185
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Good, now you get.

186
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
AI, not sell.

187
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
right down from there.

188
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Don't, aiteko me to go.

189
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Don't stop you to go for your sales.

190
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Good, miracle.

191
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Washing Market Teach in the Full Terva.

192
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Muu do your best.

193
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Well surely.

194
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Uneven racing.

195
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
early to say.

196
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Mr. The Ball of Mr. The Ball of the Reverend will increase the pace.

197
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
I too could have slipped over there.

198
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Mr. The deer is not sure to win the air competition.

199
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Niiskun Airplane would be another country.

200
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Is it fixed?

201
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:28,000
would have been waiting for the soil to make a more interesting competition.

202
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Let's go with Niisku.

203
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,000
I am sure that the miracle of the miracle has already been looking for dry.

204
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Yes, this competition will develop.

205
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
mummy troll, can I come along?

206
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Of course you get.

207
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:45,000
But shouldn't you stay to see if your grandmother wins?

208
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:49,000
maybe, but nervous so I have to get something else to think about.

209
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
then leave.

210
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,000
I have to admit that even more exciting competitions have been seen.

211
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
or what mamma?

212
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:09,000
I like peaceful competition, so you can take the cakes.

213
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
So do I.

214
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
The grass smells so good.

215
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
long from water.

216
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,000
long from water.

217
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
he no longer leaks.

218
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
I don't think.

219
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Soon to connect to the sky as a bird.

220
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
hopefully.

221
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:55,000
I am really angry about not being the first.

222
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:59,000
The laundry basket of the brisk is nothing alongside your ship.

223
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
This is beautiful.

224
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
The ball has gas again.

225
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Grandma.

226
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Niiskiiti.

227
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
fun that you came.

228
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Edit just to see my test flight.

229
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
That is a somenpi like a bunch of bravery.

230
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
is definitely. Let's start?

231
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Oi Niisku, wait a little more.

232
00:14:23,000 --> 02:11:07,000
Mom and father follow the racing between the witch and the brisk.

233
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
These have not yet returned from the lonely mountains.

234
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,000
I would like to see your father and mother to see your first flight.

235
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Good, do I have to wait a long time?

236
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Look, Grandma is coming back.

237
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:45,000
I am glad that the brilliant lost to the witch.

238
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Grandma!

239
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000
This is just growing at the top.

240
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Thanks for the gift.

241
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Immediately go to plant a rare trout.

242
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Where does Mr. The Runner Live?

243
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Sanopas.

244
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Speed, a brilliant.

245
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Where does Mr. The Righteous Post? Sanopas.

246
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Judging by the pace, he may still be on his way to the lonely mountains.

247
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:21,000
He Pöykki his basket seemed to be a rudeness, technical sense.

248
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,000
No bone. Where's Alisa?

249
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
went to see the beginning of the Niisku.

250
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:31,000
From there Alisa comes. Niiskuk is also involved.

251
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Did you get your ship in order?

252
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
I got.

253
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Then Niisku gets on the flight.

254
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Listen those, you should also fly with a nipple.

255
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:51,000
It's an organization, but the same thing that if Niisku wants and he gets his ship in the air.

256
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
The witch has already reached back.

257
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
He went so well.

258
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:02,000
When I got here now, I could pick up anyone.

259
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:08,000
But when I missed me, how do I return to the wind without the engine?

260
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:15,000
There is still little to do, if only I continued my journey.

261
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,000
This has been a memorable day, not just.

262
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
On, Pappa.

263
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Imaging, we had a brisk Hemuli, but we still had jam.

264
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,000
We had a flight competition, but still there is a test flight coming.

265
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Let's hope it goes well.

266
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Of course it goes well, Niisku.

267
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:46,000
only thank you. For the first time in my life, I feel insecure.

268
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Niisku, Miss Turn the gas faucet.

269
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Vehie looks faster than a laundry basket.

270
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:05,000
If it can now rise at all.

271
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Do you then think you are doing?

272
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
It's time.

273
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Well, for a field in front of the ship.

274
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:17,000
A runway is needed to rise. Go a little farther.

275
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,000
oh, where is your sales?

276
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:25,000
haa, sell. Niisku, sales can be hidden on your ship.

277
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
It's at all.

278
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
It's at all.

279
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
It's at all.

280
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
It's at all.

281
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
It's at all.

282
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
It's at all.

283
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Niisku, Sell can be hidden on your ship.

284
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Oh, butter.

285
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Sell, have you locked the door?

286
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Open.

287
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Calm down, Niisku.

288
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Sell, open immediately.

289
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,000
oxidize, unable to concentrate on these levers.

290
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
to concentrate? What?

291
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
to focus on levers.

292
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Hi Sell, you just don't try to start the engine.

293
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:10,000
I want to try what the lever is doing.

294
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,000
does not suddenly come to hold the ship.

295
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Myy has been raised in the cab and tries to rise.

296
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Could you sell the ship in the air?

297
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Of course not. It's impossible.

298
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:29,000
If he succeeded, I wouldn't be the first to fly on board.

299
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
I wouldn't stand it with Warranty.

300
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Oops, you just just that I get the plunge.

301
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Sell, you stop servicing and come out.

302
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Sell, please.

303
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,000
A small magic could be in place.

304
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Oh, the door is open.

305
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Let me come along!

306
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:53,000
You can come, but today because it is a test flight.

307
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
It is dangerous.

308
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Do you think something can't happen?

309
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:04,000
does not happen. The ship is well designed.

310
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
I can come along.

311
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
You can only happen.

312
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
What would that mean?

313
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Sell, you stop!

314
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Calm down Little Sell I promise you to get on the first flight I take passengers.

315
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:26,000
What if there is a gas leak or the ship becomes a tuus, then I can ever get on.

316
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Little, why do you say that? In the brother, the ship does not go to Tuusen.

317
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Well, now I'm in the air.

318
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Be careful.

319
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Loss happily.

320
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Don't be rested, Misku knows what he's doing.

321
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
The ship moves forward.

322
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
It moves.

323
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:28,000
The ship cannot rise. It slides only along the grass.

324
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Why didn't I get to the helm?

325
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Reserve!

326
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
It was close.

327
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:44,000
The laundry may be slower, but at least it rises into the air.

328
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
is a stroke.

329
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,000
There is still hope, a good mother.

330
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
The ship comes straight.

331
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Best of the run.

332
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Oh Mumma!

333
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:19,000
It is embarrassing to fly to their nose.

334
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Bone Fall.

335
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Mummy!

336
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Misku, don't come out!

337
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Mummy Power!

338
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
I have not taken over.

339
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
misk, don't come off!

340
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Mummy power! Let's run away!

341
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Rise, now get up Kylös Kylös.

342
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Alisa is careful!

343
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Fly, oh fly!

344
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Miska Tekinen, he flies!

345
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
No!

346
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Miska, hell!

347
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,000
I succeeded, I succeeded.

348
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
I finally fly.

349
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Vaphsemic means of transport.

350
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,000
It's better than your bone.

351
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Not a single one.

352
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
How so?

353
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Testing sluut on the aircraft.

354
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Watch out not to break a flywheel like I've been together!

355
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Thank you.
