Do you carry a bag between?

11
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
It's not heavy.

12
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Thank you. We get to the point and there we can rest.

13
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Do you remember the tighter and the nuance with king's ruby?

14
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,000
They have returned to the Moomin Valley with their suitcase.

15
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
There is smoke from the Moomin House barrel.

16
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Good, mummamma cooks for dinner.

17
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Moomins are so nice.

18
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
They will break our print.

19
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
when we have such a wonderful gift for them.

20
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Yeah, I'm sure the Moomins will scream for joy when you see it.

21
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Do you continue your journey?

22
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Yeah.

23
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I now carry my suitcase.

24
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Yes I still can.

25
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:55,000
oh, from KuPS. Sorry, lighter than I imagined.

26
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
The bag is in ...

27
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I know, gift for me.

28
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
didn't, there is a gift for the Moomins.

29
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
They have houseworking stuff, they don't need anything.

30
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
The suitcase is ours.

31
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
count it in the world. Thanks.

32
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,000
We want a gift for the Moomins even if they don't need.

33
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
What to do now, Navy?

34
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I don't know.

35
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Does that Kelmi live here?

36
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I don't know, I don't see this last time.

37
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
What's the advice?

38
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
This misery is locked.

39
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Disifestly!

40
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Why should everything be locked?

41
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I want to open the suitcase.

42
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
River a small object there is.

43
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,000
But a little object can be thematic.

44
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
opened.

45
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
What is this?

46
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
looks like a tulip onion.

47
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
True.

48
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
A little different anyway.

49
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
You?

50
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Whatever the suitcase it is.

51
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Well mine. What are you right?

52
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Why didn't you open your suitcase?

53
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I was watching you.

54
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
as a lust.

55
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
or so.

56
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Do you mean that you locked the bag?

57
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Of course I mean.

58
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Do you consider me crazy?

59
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Where does that suitcase come from?

60
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Say.

61
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
You have stolen your suitcase.

62
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
And I'm not.

63
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I found it from the ground.

64
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Only this onion had.

65
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
important.

66
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Stink not.

67
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
He can't eat it.

68
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Own.

69
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
It's not the tulip onion.

70
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
What's the strange thing?

71
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I donate you the whole onion and suitcase.

72
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Welcome.

73
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Hi, Teikko.

74
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
fun to see.

75
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
for a long time.

76
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
say anything else.

77
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Come in now.

78
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
does not stay here at the stairs.

79
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
The most, ultimate.

80
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Father guests.

81
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
A very good day.

82
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
New week.

83
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Welcome.

84
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Welcome.

85
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Welcome.

86
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Good day.

87
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
What a hustle and bustle.

88
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Tiuhti and Viuhti.

89
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
You have not been seen at times.

90
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Moominpappa, we bring you a very wonderful gift.

91
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
It would not have been necessary.

92
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
You are always welcome.

93
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Moominmamma, we come up with a great gift for you.

94
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Goodbye. Thanks.

95
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Do you like our gift?

96
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Of course I like.

97
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
What is that gift?

98
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I'm pretty excited.

99
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Oh miserable, sorry.

100
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
The gift was stolen on the way.

101
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
stolen?

102
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
It was such an extremely fun gift.

103
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I would have certainly liked your gift.

104
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
How sad?

105
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I would have liked to see it.

106
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Moominmamma, Can we visit your nature?

107
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Even though we don't have expensive.

108
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Of course, stay for as long as you want.

109
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Did you hear, Viutti?

110
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I heard and I'm happy.

111
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Thank you, Moominmamma.

112
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Please tell me more about where the gift was stolen from you.

113
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
here near.

114
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
in the Moomin Valley?

115
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
That's right. It was stolen in the soil.

116
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,000
There are not many thieves in these corners.

117
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Not that way.

118
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
and the one I know.

119
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Stink!

120
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
No stink!

121
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Stinky shark!

122
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Stink!

123
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Don't bother.

124
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
You can see that you were currently in Nokos.

125
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Give the goods you stole from our guests.

126
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Your guests? Oh from them.

127
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
aha, you stole.

128
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
I don't know what you are talking about.

129
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
You stole a wonderful gift from our guests.

130
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Give it here.

131
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Give it back before I get angry or I against the consequences.

132
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
so calm down.

133
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Own troll, what did you say?

134
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Give it a gift.

135
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Do you talk about some ideal gift?

136
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
I spoke. How?

137
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Wonderful gift.

138
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
This is just ...

139
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
When you laugh.

140
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Ihihi!

141
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:35,000
ahaa. Now it became clear from whom the stolen has stolen the suitcase.

142
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
The gift is not lost.

143
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
No, but it's no longer here.

144
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Where is it?

145
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I took it to Hemul to investigate which plant the tuber it is.

146
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I also took a suitcase.

147
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
or the gift is tuber.

148
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
So some onion.

149
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
That's right.

150
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:57,000
It looked like a tulip onion, but I don't really think that's it.

151
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,000
I came that a wonderful gift is an old onion.

152
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
It can be a very rare plant onion.

153
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Hemuli couldn't know it.

154
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
I wish the gift would have been another ruby.

155
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
ruby?

156
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Oh yeah. After all, the fan had stolen a ruby ​​from Mörö and hid it in a suitcase.

157
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
air, the bag was familiar.

158
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Have you stolen the onion?

159
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
How do you know?

160
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Let's go see what Hemuli is doing.

161
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Hemuli!

162
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Grow, good day.

163
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Is that onion I brought yesterday?

164
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Void looking.

165
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
I'm just planting it.

166
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Which plant is it?

167
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,000
No dream. I've never seen the same thing.

168
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Then it must be a rare plant onion.

169
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
I am a little worried.

170
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
What?

171
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:11,000
The onion is damaged. Hopefully the schools it experienced will not prevent it from germinating.

172
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Ah, now I remember. The stink tried to taste the onion.

173
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
It's a villain!

174
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Hi Hemuli, don't plant onions yet.

175
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
oh, why not?

176
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Let's take the onion to the one for whom it is intended.

177
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
about.

178
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Here comes water!

179
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Well, is this?

180
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Visit, please.

181
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Tiuhti and Viuhti, now tell us what plant it is?

182
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
controlled from elite.

183
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Good, look when ...

184
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Wait, Tiuhti!

185
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
What now, Viuhti?

186
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Well, when I want to tell the whole story.

187
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
So well, what's up?

188
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Better, of course, that you tell.

189
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Tell me already.

190
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Look when we start from the beginning so the onion is not from here at all.

191
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:26,000
The onion comes from somewhere very far, even farther than the moon.

192
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Good to meet.

193
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:34,000
And therefore it is less common than any other onion and great gift for our friends for us.

194
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Unique onion.

195
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,000
And the most unique is that it starts to sing.

196
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
I guess.

197
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Yes, the flower sings very well, it has a good voice.

198
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Sorry, just continue.

199
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
and it sings special songs.

200
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Thanks to the botany.

201
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,000
But maybe it's good that not all flowers sing.

202
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Where did you find the onion?

203
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Would I tell you?

204
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Same.

205
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
After all, we are not forbidden.

206
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Tell me by wonder. Who did you get onion unless you come from space?

207
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
no magician.

208
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Of course.

209
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:19,000
The magician liked the onion, but even more ruby.

210
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
We did barter.

211
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:27,000
The magician already had a ruby, but he apparently wanted it. That's what.

212
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:31,000
But you are happy to give him up from ruby.

213
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:38,000
We had had it for a long time and were sure we should be singing the flower.

214
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
It is clear.

215
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
was good.

216
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:45,000
We had a lot of trouble when we were last in the Moomin House.

217
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
We are in great dedication.

218
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
We made our mind come again.

219
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:53,000
fun to hear. Thanks.

220
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:59,000
I felt that the onion would already be a wise to learn the water bowl.

221
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
It is sure to be.

222
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
We monitor its development.

223
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
and when it bursts into the flower, it starts with a launa.

224
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Just next to the note.

225
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
How soon that flower.

226
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
in two days.

227
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Well the sky.

228
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Let it suddenly put it in the water.

229
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
you.

230
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Good.

231
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
I immerse the onion.

232
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Only two days.

233
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Bum papa, can you stay here?

234
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
You can of course.

235
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
I too will be left.

236
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Two days had passed.

237
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
and then three.

238
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
and soon a full week.

239
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,000
But the onion was quite like.

240
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Ten days had passed.

241
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
and the onion looked as lifeless as before.

242
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
I speak.

243
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Visits went for a walk.

244
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:31,000
I almost believed I could see the song but anyone.

245
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,000
maybe the onion has received too much moisture.

246
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,000
It is very possible, mom.

247
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:41,000
The bite of the smell did not do it good.

248
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Witch is our only chance.

249
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
But dangerous.

250
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
I don't like this at all.

251
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
We've got lost.

252
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Tilti!

253
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Come on! Come on!

254
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
did not go.

255
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Don't worry.

256
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Help! Tilti was aquered.

257
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Help! Help! Come and save your tilt!

258
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Tilti!

259
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
So you can't do it.

260
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Unfortunately not.

261
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Grandma could make the onion germinate, but I probably can't.

262
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Looking at when I haven't completely learned the witch yet.

263
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,000
When will your grandmother come back home?

264
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Not for a short time.

265
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,000
I wouldn't run here by the way.

266
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
What are you now?

267
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
There is hot drink here.

268
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Yes, I can.

269
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
What did you say?

270
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Yes, it grows into a real singing flower.

271
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,000
grow and it sings beautifully.

272
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Believe me.

273
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Hi TIHTI.

274
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,000
I am sure that one day, the onion will still germinate.

275
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,000
It would be fun to hear anyone singing.

276
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Everybody has given up to hope for the hope that the onion would grow a singing flower.

277
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Hemulik, who was so excited about the gift of Tiuhdi and Navy.

278
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Why not germinate?

279
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Do you see signs of germination?

280
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Not visible.

281
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Did you stop watching?

282
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:15,000
I quit. Hard to observe when there is nothing to observe.

283
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
It came to mind here.

284
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
What?

285
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:33,000
I've heard that some people call plants.

286
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:37,000
that they would grow better and it really helps.

287
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:41,000
so reportedly. Unscientific, though.

288
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:47,000
If you tried, and what would the music fit on the bulb?

289
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:53,000
If it grows into a singing flower, you would think that any music will bring life to it.

290
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Yeah, of course. Great!

291
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,000
sniffing, come already!

292
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,000
and don't just sit in it. We have a job.

293
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
But Hemuli!

294
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Without you, nothing will come from this.

295
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
What sound is it?

296
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,000
sniffing gummy plays a harmonica on the onion.

297
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
What's the miracle?

298
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
I don't know.

299
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:52,000
I suppose we should gradually end the visit? Our gift was a completely wolf.

300
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Not that useful.

301
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Well, that's what it looks like.

302
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Would you like a cup of tea?

303
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Ah, yes thank you.

304
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Good idea.

305
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Why didn't call?

306
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,000
The onion should be spent on the onion!

307
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
The pain of it is effective.

308
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
already!

309
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Well now what was it?

310
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:46,000
useless that onion to lame it so that it does not germinate.

311
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
sshh! Shut up.

312
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
I hear something.

313
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
What?

314
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
I hear something.

315
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
I hear something.

316
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
I hear something.

317
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
I hear something.

318
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
I hear something.

319
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
I hear something.

320
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Onion this!

321
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
It grows.

322
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Onion this!

323
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Mummamma!

324
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
mummy!

325
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
The singing flower has germinated.

326
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
It has leaves!

327
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Did the lip got my harp at that time?

328
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Incredible ta.

329
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
How can you go to you?

330
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Be crazy too.

331
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,000
It really looks like it could sing.

332
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
You were right.

333
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
That's what we said.

334
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
nice plant.

335
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Very nice.

336
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Sorry to doubt.

337
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
seemed so incredible.

338
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Grandma would be amazed at this.

339
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
I hear.

340
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
I hear.

341
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
When you sleep, you get hungry.

342
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
New album.

343
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Good appetite.

344
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Hemuli planted the honor of the singing flower.

345
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:40,000
But still far enough from his house, it would not control him.

346
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Thank you.
