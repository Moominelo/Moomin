A rest

10
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:55,000
The rest of the valley seemed to reach hard.

11
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Our hero had drifted to the islands, after all, did not offer a safe harbor.

12
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:11,000
new dangers. Hazards? What happens to our hero?

13
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:17,000
The islands have a volcano and discharges and the whole island flies to the sky.

14
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
But then the hero's story is over.

15
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
This is cold.

16
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I should have closed the window when Tuomainen's storm is raging.

17
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,000
of course a terrible storm coming.

18
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Good storm. This is fun to write.

19
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
about.

20
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Don't go out for a long time.

21
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I can't blow as big as you.

22
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
It will not work with a straw pill.

23
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Beautiful. Just like snow.

24
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I'll get more.

25
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
You can't. They are mine.

26
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
You races nicely.

27
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I also want to hang out the snow series.

28
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Hi, Moomintroll.

29
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
What?

30
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Sorry for intervening to play.

31
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
But could you be a little quieter?

32
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I try to focus on writing.

33
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Yeah. Thanks.

34
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
What to do?

35
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
This can be done quietly. Let's go out.

36
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Wind. I just came up with a new play.

37
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Celebration!

38
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Celebration!

39
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
This is how it is flown.

40
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I suspect we are too heavy.

41
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
This is a little mill.

42
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
could have a pool. I come to the fire.

43
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Niippu, you didn't happen.

44
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
This is a boring play.

45
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Celebration!

46
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Where the little one is selling now.

47
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Celebration!

48
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
This is coming.

49
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I?

50
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
No, I am ...

51
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Help!

52
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Hi, hey, hey.

53
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
did not happen.

54
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Oh Saint Sylvi.

55
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Hi Sell!

56
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Look.

57
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Is there someone at home?

58
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Here at the top, Moomin mirror.

59
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
What's the case, so muli?

60
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I'm repairing when Little My Sell landed on my neck.

61
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
ahaa.

62
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Rocket will be destroyed here.

63
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,000
But not. Nearly as much.

64
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Hi, don't wolf useless.

65
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
We will repair the teddy bear of the houses.

66
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
like that?

67
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
or what?

68
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
fun. I've never built anything.

69
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Your house is better than a new one.

70
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I don't know.

71
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,000
We should paint the entire house in bright colors.

72
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
as it seems gloomy.

73
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:26,000
I have paint at home. Let's start to get tools right away.

74
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
We will soon be back.

75
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Area is there any ability?

76
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
The wind calmed down.

77
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
and I finally get to spread the laundry.

78
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,000
What a pleasure to drink day coffee on the porch.

79
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Pappa gold, how's your book progress?

80
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
That's it.

81
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
me, dad!

82
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I borrow us with wheelbarrows.

83
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
and saw and hammer.

84
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
What's in it?

85
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Search for board pieces from the basement.

86
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
clear.

87
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Nipsu! Today is not done and not playing.

88
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
I'm not playing.

89
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
What are you doing with mopes?

90
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Paint the walls.

91
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Paint?

92
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Don't be restless.

93
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
We return to food.

94
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Moomintroll, what are you going to?

95
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
We are now going to repair Hemul's house.

96
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
AI!

97
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Hello then!

98
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I look for a goal.

99
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Nipsu, Anna Board.

100
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
As long as I go.

101
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
O Nipsu, Ressu.

102
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Do you need help?

103
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
No thanks, I can.

104
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
O.

105
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Give me between me.

106
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
No!

107
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Give the same.

108
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Don't mess up my thoughts.

109
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Good, good.

110
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Nipsu, speed!

111
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Don't look.

112
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Let's see what you did.

113
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
This is not so dangerous.

114
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Return to Lapland and immediately.

115
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Oh heaven.

116
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
You are not your way.

117
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Go to collect the plant.

118
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Everything here is in control.

119
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
that ...

120
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:08,000
I will not be happy to leave my house on their desire.

121
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
The following week, Hemuli lived in the Moomin House.

122
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:22,000
The Moomintroll and its partners were up to her house while.

123
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Moomin.

124
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
mummamma and mummy.

125
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
kas memmel?

126
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Days.

127
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Do you also go to the hemulil?

128
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
We are.

129
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
The house is reportedly ready.

130
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
I heard that the little night was dumb.

131
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
My house ento.

132
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
You would let him be painted.

133
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Well why not?

134
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
me and dad!

135
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Hi Moomintroll!

136
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Good work must be granted.

137
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
so I do.

138
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Let's go inside.

139
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Oio.

140
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Joas.

141
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,000
A little enough for the old person.

142
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,000
No, no, excellent botanist.

143
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Yes, just beautiful.

144
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Do you think?

145
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Hemuli and you don't like the result?

146
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I like. It's unusual.

147
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,000
In the mornings you can get your eyes as soon as you open to the plant knowledge.

148
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
May I cinnamon you hemuli.

149
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
It's fun to hear.

150
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:38,000
The room can inspire you to do something fine weak.

151
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
fine.

152
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
You can dream of new plants.

153
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
You do not think scientifically.

154
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
hehehehe.

155
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
hehehehe.

156
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
butter.

157
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
hehehehe.

158
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Share.

159
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
hehehehe.

160
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
hehehehe.

161
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
hehehehe.

162
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
hehehehe.

163
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
hehehehe.

164
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
hehehehe.

165
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
hehehehe.

166
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
hehehehe.

167
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
in a good way.

168
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
I don't feel bad for me.

169
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:37,000
From tonight, Hemul was bothered by a strange sleep.

170
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Where am I?

171
00:11:54,000 --> 00:12:04,000
I have seen flowers before. New species.

172
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:14,000
oh, oh, oh, oh.

173
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Professor Hemuli and I haven't found a new plant?

174
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Else.

175
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:31,000
A lovely room should inspire you to revolutionize discoveries.

176
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Listen, there are not so many new plants.

177
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
How do you know if they have not been found?

178
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
cannot be many.

179
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Find even one, Professor Hemuli.

180
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
The Vuone helps you find.

181
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Professor Hemuli.

182
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Stop, stop already.

183
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Stop, no.

184
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:03,000
It was just a dream.

185
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Professor Hemuli.

186
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Let me be.

187
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:24,000
terrible, I can't sleep in my house.

188
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:34,000
All here is fine.

189
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,000
All here is fine.

190
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,000
oh, oh, oh.

191
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Hemuli.

192
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Bike, from the police.

193
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Why are you up this time?

194
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Only a small walk before I go again.

195
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Oh heaven.

196
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Good night.

197
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Walking nightgown on.

198
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
What are you playing today?

199
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Let's think.

200
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
I know.

201
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
I'm not going to fly on an umbrella.

202
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,000
fool, not even wind today.

203
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:19,000
I thought we would continue to renovate Hemul's house.

204
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Good idea.

205
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Also painted outside the house.

206
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Do you immediately put on?

207
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
What's it?

208
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Hemuli.

209
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Hemuli, Hemuli.

210
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,000
day but.

211
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Why do you sleep here?

212
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,000
I saw such horrible dreams in my room.

213
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:54,000
I kept walking and then I started to sleep.

214
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,000
If you sleep, sleep in beautiful rooms.

215
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
That's right.

216
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:03,000
We were just coming to see how your house can handle.

217
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:07,000
We have also decided to paint your house from outside.

218
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Don't come to paint.

219
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Why not?

220
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
You have already done enough.

221
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Don't think I can get to the house bouquet.

222
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Go play.

223
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
now home.

224
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
It was strange to use from Hemul.

225
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Well, so do we.

226
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Moomin -troll, you said that Hemuli horti at night press.

227
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:45,000
I just met the police champion and said he had seen Hemul in the woods on a nightgown.

228
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Hemuli had seemed very sleepy.

229
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Does Ressukka suffer from insomnia?

230
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Don't be injured, Moomin -troll, but maybe Hemuli has not adapted to new colors in her home.

231
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
The Hemuliha was very pleased.

232
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:06,000
at least he said so and the walls herself in recession.

233
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
So yes.

234
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,000
No, no, stop, don't!

235
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,000
No, there is nothing to sleep.

236
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
oh, Hemuli.

237
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Are you fish now?

238
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,000
I don't, no sint. Fish can sleep.

239
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,000
happy fish.

240
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Well, good night, a believer.

241
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Good night.

242
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Ah, you saw Hemul?

243
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,000
like that, and he seemed terribly tired.

244
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,000
maybe Dad was right after all.

245
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:09,000
You should ask Hemulio yourself.

246
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Niai. If Hemuli is unable to sleep because of our paintings, something must be done.

247
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Hemuli, do you hide something from us?

248
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:23,000
that I was secret from you something impossible.

249
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,000
You look terrifying tired.

250
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,000
I also tired. Look at it.

251
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,000
oh, I'm careful.

252
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,000
This is nothing. I was peak when I got up too suddenly.

253
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:46,000
If you can't sleep at home, that is, because of the walls.

254
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,000
The painting easily goes into a former color.

255
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,000
oh, no, no, no. You need to.

256
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,000
After all, I can sleep first at night.

257
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,000
oh, can't.

258
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Isn't that?

259
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,000
cannot.

260
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
It does not.

261
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,000
It doesn't get.

262
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,000
It doesn't get.

263
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,000
It doesn't get.

264
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Is it?

265
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Don't get.

266
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Sorry to penetrate home.

267
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,000
I don't do it for another.

268
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Hi, Pölle.

269
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Be happy when you can monitor all night without feeling tired.

270
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,000
oh, oh, oh.

271
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Not to sleep.

272
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Where does that look come from?

273
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Oh heaven, oh heaven, can life.

274
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,000
oh that still flowers.

275
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Moomintroll, Moomintroll.

276
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,000
oh, Hemuli.

277
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,000
up, up, right up.

278
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Moomin Pappa, wake up, wake up.

279
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Wake -up, Moomin mom.

280
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,000
AI, Hemuli.

281
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,000
What has happened?

282
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Come and not.

283
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,000
What has happened?

284
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Come and it is not.

285
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Look.

286
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,000
I haven't seen anything as beautiful.

287
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,000
what flowers.

288
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Nothing when the forest dark.

289
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,000
and they bloom only at the center.

290
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,000
so no one has seen them.

291
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,000
After all, you have found a new sport.

292
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,000
So I am.

293
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,000
I have made a great discovery.

294
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Great, your celebrity only increases.

295
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Congratulations.

296
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Hemuli, I'm happy for you.

297
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Departure has found.

298
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Muni and partners have honor.

299
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,000
What?

300
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Elet would have painted in my house and took a night's sleep.

301
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,000
I wouldn't have found flowers.

302
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,000
I'm playing gratitude.

303
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,000
To be honest I.

304
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Well that's it. The matter has been dealt with.

305
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:41,000
ice mamma, will tomorrow a big party will be held in honor of Hemul's discovery?

306
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Good idea.

307
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Let's get into bed to get up to get up to prepare.

308
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Thank you.

309
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Pull you like you to sleep.

310
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,000
I will be here to make observations.

311
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,000
know even if the flowers disappear, for example, in the morning.

312
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,000
What's found?

313
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Suddenly painted the only one.

314
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Hope Hemuli is now surprised.

315
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,000
What is that Äliina?

316
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Let's see it.

317
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,000
No Hemuli will come.

318
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Good morning Hemuli.

319
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,000
We paint all the surfaces into a former color.

320
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,000
You can sleep properly again.

321
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,000
may what have you seen?

322
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Stop painting immediately.

323
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Try to paint my bedroom again.

324
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,000
I like it and now I fall into the shit.

325
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,000
That way, Hemuli learned to keep his variegated room.

326
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,000
He slept well again, but sometimes went for a walk at night.

327
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,000
You don't know what you can find at night.

328
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,000
he is still still.

329
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,000
he is still still.

330
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,000
he is still still.

331
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,000
You can find at night.
