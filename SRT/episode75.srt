18
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Behind the waterfall you will find what you are looking for.

19
00:02:04,099 --> 00:02:06,000
I'm not looking for anything.

20
00:02:06,099 --> 00:02:08,000
Behind the waterfall.

21
00:02:08,099 --> 00:02:11,000
What can I find there?

22
00:02:13,099 --> 00:02:15,000
got.

23
00:02:15,099 --> 00:02:17,000
got.

24
00:02:17,099 --> 00:02:19,000
got.

00:02:21,099 --> 00:02:23,000

00:02:23,099 --> 00:02:25,000

32
00:02:42,099 --> 00:02:45,000
got.

33
00:02:45,099 --> 00:02:49,000
Aaaaaah!

34
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Well, it was an impressive sleep.

35
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:09,000
was. I have often dreamed that I fall or fly, but I have never happened to me in a dream that I was looking for something.

36
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Are you sure to find?

37
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I've been thinking a lot about it, but I'm not looking for anything.

38
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,000
ahaa. Have you seen that waterfall?

39
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Well I'm not. Hi, I have heard.

40
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Who has told about it?

41
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
You.

42
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I?

43
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
You.

44
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
After all, it exists?

45
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
You said it is in lonely mountains.

46
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Oh, take me there. Sleep is bothering me so I can't get it.

47
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
It was sleep.

48
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Let's go with me.

49
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Aarua, stuffed.

50
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Good.

51
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I am watered.

52
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Then go to bed.

53
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I think I go.

54
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Mom, I'm leaving with Nuuska -Muikkunen in the morning.

55
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Let's go.

56
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Let's go.

57
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Let's go.

58
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Let's go.

59
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Let's go.

60
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Let's go.

61
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
with Muikkunen on an excursion to the lonely mountains.

62
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
What, before breakfast?

63
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Yeah, do you pack for us for a snack?

64
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Of course.

65
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Thank you, good night.

66
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Mamma, where did Moomin Pekka said he was going?

67
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
for lonely mountains.

68
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Time far.

69
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
After all.

70
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
So early and so in the car.

71
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Only for a fun trip.

72
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
He secretly something.

73
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
How?

74
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I don't think he was so tired that he had to go to bed.

75
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
oh, don't you?

76
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
He has something in mind.

77
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I feel the signs you need excitement.

78
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
He may be in trouble.

79
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
It's best for me to follow her.

80
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Thank you, mother.

81
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Good morning, snus Muikkunen.

82
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Good morning.

83
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I have a lunch for each of us.

84
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
The mother is a pleasure.

85
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Thank you, mother.

86
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Thank you, mother.

87
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Thank you, mother.

88
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Thank you, mother.

89
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Thank you, mother.

90
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
The mother is a joy.

91
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Well, wonder.

92
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
The Moomintroll is early.

93
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Oops, you flowers anyway.

94
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I didn't expect it at all this year.

95
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I mentioned something fun with you in noiku.

96
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I didn't know it was so far away.

97
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Is it?

98
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Well a little.

99
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
rest.

100
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Yes I can. What about you?

101
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I'm a walker.

102
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Fitness deceives.

103
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Straight to follow and stay hidden here.

104
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Row already!

105
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Do you think we'll find something?

106
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
I'm not so sure. That was just a dream.

107
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
So.

108
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Remote if Mars is out and I say I'm hungry.

109
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I might get something to eat.

110
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,000
No. They could be secured as a nose.

111
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
What are the subject looking for?

112
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Something valuable or not?

113
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,000
This is the waterfall I've seen in my dream.

114
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,000
But you really don't know what you should look for.

115
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
No idea.

116
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Dreams are remarkable.

117
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
walk behind the waterfall and watch a little.

118
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
does not look very inviting.

119
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
This is the waterfall I've seen in my dream.

120
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
does not look very inviting.

121
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Here's a slippery Faro. I look at where you step.

122
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
This is where Turkey gets wet.

123
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Now we have come right behind the waterfall.

124
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I don't see anything special.

125
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
ahead.

126
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
What's that?

127
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
What's so?

128
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Green!

129
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Probably emeraldy.

130
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
It's beautiful.

131
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Are you looking for emerald in your dream?

132
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
I didn't look.

133
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
What else would you have been looking for?

134
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
There is nothing else here.

135
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:24,000
After all, such a great emerald is good to look for anyone.

136
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
It's terribly large.

137
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
know the biggest that exists.

138
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:33,000
If it were smaller, the lady could like it.

139
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
someone screams.

140
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
someone screaming at us.

141
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,000
This is a load, makeup and really could be rushed.

142
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
over there.

143
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
views.

144
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
help me!

145
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:55,000
At least I didn't dream of saving the stink.

146
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
He has overshadowed us.

147
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Heaven's stitch, stop slipping and start to help.

148
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,000
As a terrible wound.

149
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Aisuli, we help. Stay in places.

150
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Stay, stay.

151
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
This is a larger gemstone.

152
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I don't sleep as good as Moomin, Pekko.

153
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
I also.

154
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:39,000
But I didn't dream of gemstones.

155
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Differently fine.

156
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:48,000
But of course Hemuli friend we value more of his rare plants.

157
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,000
of course. I wouldn't change them anywhere.

158
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Not even for this rainy stone. As beautiful as it is.

159
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
jewels are the best I know.

160
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
I agree.

161
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Mom, you get emerald.

162
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Thank you, Moomin Pekko.

163
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:09,000
I would take the emerald mind well, but you have to keep it.

164
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:14,000
As your dream became true, you are supposed to keep the emerald.

165
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:23,000
It's gorgeous, but what can you do with it?

166
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:33,000
It would be a great letter weight, but I rarely get mail.

167
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Fire rain.

168
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Oh, will it come?

169
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,000
If the children are outdoors, they get wet.

170
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,000
They get wet anyway because they went for a swim.

171
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Now drops.

172
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Do you go to the cave shelter? You are already wet.

173
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
I'm dry and I'm going to stay dry.

174
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Little, come. I'll take you to the cave.

175
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,000
ha ha, you dare not go there alone.

176
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:40,000
I am afraid of very few things, but there is a thunderstorm alone.

177
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
in that style.

178
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
what's the rain?

179
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Hi, it rains.

180
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
AI, AI, AI.

181
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
This is too much.

182
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,000
it rains so that it is painful.

183
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Caspin!

184
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
All my plant is.

185
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
What do I do?

186
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
AI, AI, AI.

187
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,000
AI, AI, AI. What a hando.

188
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
I rotated to this place.

189
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Raikku passed.

190
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000
unprecedented granules.

191
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,000
There must have been a lot of bad sheds.

192
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Yes.

193
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Yeah.

194
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Hood Papa, disaster!

195
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
granules would knock Hemul.

196
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Oh, abomination.

197
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Hemul is carried here.

198
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
I can no longer carry a meter.

199
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Don't always choose.

200
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
in the eyes of the dark.

201
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Hemuli!

202
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,000
All ruined past.

203
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Father, the frenzy brought Hemul's flower and greenhouse.

204
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
It's horrible.

205
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:03,000
All my plant, all my lovely flowers are crushed.

206
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Everything is over.

207
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,000
carry Hemuli in.

208
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Speed!

209
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Hood priest, I rotated.

210
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Nipsu, don't exaggerate.

211
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Step at once, nips, yes you can.

212
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Cover Hemuli in.

213
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Carefully count him on the couch.

214
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
His hard fever has risen.

215
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
about the nerve shock, I'm sure.

216
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Let's go immediately to mix the medicine.

217
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Rocking my plant, all past.

218
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Don't go.

219
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Hardly any more garden can be obtained.

220
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
by no means.

221
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:53,000
We do something, Hemuli does not wish for IKI in the world.

222
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:58,000
I am sure that the garden can be planted again.

223
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
This will not work.

224
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Of course we could plant some species, but Hemuli has collected plants around the world.

225
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Magic is used.

226
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
magic?

227
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Could you do something?

228
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,000
I doubt his abilities in this matter.

229
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
I have anyone.

230
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
I'm sure.

231
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
I'm sure.

232
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
I'm sure.

233
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:41,000
It is useless for me to complain that Hemuli has experienced tough and not to recover.

234
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
But you are a witch.

235
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Can't you really do anything for Hemul's garden?

236
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:51,000
I do not say that it crosses Martini.

237
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:56,000
But when Hemuli is so depressed you can't get out of bed.

238
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
It does not add Martiani.

239
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Let's leave.

240
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
hmm.

241
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Moomintroll, a pity that we didn't help.

242
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,000
If you can't do anything so you can't.

243
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,000
The matter will not heal.

244
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
There is also a limits for the witch.

245
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
I've had to notice it.

246
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
It's sad.

247
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Hi then Alisa.

248
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Hello.

249
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
O.

250
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
ahaa, I come up with.

251
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
What did you get?

252
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:39,000
What do you think, would a magician be able to return the garden to the former?

253
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
magician?

254
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Once we were hopeful for anything and the magician fulfilled our wishes.

255
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,000
True, the magician is able to help us.

256
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,000
But how do we find him?

257
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Hi Alisa.

258
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
What?

259
00:17:54,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Could you ask your grandmother, does she know how to connect to the magician?

260
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Well and did you know where to find a magician?

261
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:13,000
apparently. The witch jumped on the bone's back and went looking for him.

262
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Oh, maybe those should already come back.

263
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,000
The magician does not live next door.

264
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,000
We just have to wait.

265
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,000
I'm worried about Hemul.

266
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Don't give, grandma is next to her.

267
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Well, now is better Hemuli Rukka.

268
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:53,000
From there, that magician comes on the back of the band.

269
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Witch found him!

270
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,000
We need to reward witch.

271
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Hope the magician is well on.

272
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Never, except when he got a royal bubble from Tiudi and Vadi.

273
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
You called me.

274
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,000
We desperately need the help of the magician.

275
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:28,000
I'm not a magician called from any whim.

276
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Of course you are not, we are very sorry that we have to bother you.

277
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
No one else can help.

278
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:39,000
and most recently the magician fulfilled all our wishes.

279
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:44,000
But you did a great service for me.

280
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,000
I also do not run home visits.

281
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:55,000
For your service you have already received a reward, even abundant if you allow you to add.

282
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Can we do another service?

283
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
You are not.

284
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Don't we?

285
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,000
No, no. Hardly just.

286
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
How so?

287
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:09,000
You brought me a good time, it doesn't happen.

288
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
What service could we do?

289
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
five of it.

290
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
We want to know.

291
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Let it be the past.

292
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:28,000
With you, I finally got them to King Rubin.

293
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
so?

294
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
But I'm missing.

295
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:35,000
The finest of emeralds, Queen emerald.

296
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,000
I don't want to wait 300 years.

297
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,000
emerald, other troll.

298
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Magician, wait.

299
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Why?

300
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,000
succeeds, Queen emerald.

301
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
This is it.

302
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
This is it.

303
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Queen emerald, I can't believe this.

304
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Queen emerald, I can't believe this.

305
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Queen emerald, I can't believe this.

306
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Good night.

307
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Good night.

308
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Good night, my troll.

309
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:36,000
After this incident, the rest of the other fellows always fell asleep in the hope of a lovely sleep.

310
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:44,000
But if he had a dream, he didn't remember it anymore in the morning.

311
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Thank you.
